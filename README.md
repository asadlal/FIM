## 📂 Repository Structure

### 📂 `Supplementary Material`

This folder contains the **Supplementary Material** for the paper "Father-Inspired Metaheuristic: A New Human-Based Optimization Approach". It includes the **simulation results** and the **convergence curve graphs** for **CEC2017 (30D and 50D)**.

-----

### 📂 `Matlab Code`

This folder contains all the files necessary to run the experiments.

  * **📂 `Algorithms`**
      * Contains **FIM** and all competitor algorithms: **GA, TLBO, WSO, WO, GSA, WOA, GWO, AVOA, RSA, MPA, TSA, MVO**.
  * **📄 `FIM_Comparison.m`**
      * The main script. It runs **FIM** and all competitor algorithms on the selected benchmarks and automatically saves all results (Excel files, convergence plots, and representative graphs).
  * **📄 `run_ranksum.m`**
      * Runs the **Wilcoxon rank-sum test** and stores the p-value results.
  * **📄 `CEC2017.m`**
      * Defines the CEC2017 benchmark functions (**F1, F3 to F30**). Function **F2** is explicitly excluded.
  * **📄 `fun_info.m`**
      * Defines the classical benchmark functions (**F1 to F23**).
  * **📄 `Func_eng.m`**
      * Defines the engineering design problems: **Pressure Vessel, Spring Design, Three-Bar Truss, Gear Train, and Cantilever Beam**.
  * **📂 `input_data`**
      * Contains additional files required by some benchmark problems.

-----

### 📂 `Simulation Results`

The **Simulation Results** folder contains the final simulation outputs used in the paper.

* **📂 `CEC2017`**
    * Contains the Excel file with results for **CEC2017 benchmarks** (**F1, F3 to F30**, except **F2**), (`CEC2017`).
    * Includes **best, average, worst, median, and standard deviation** values.
* **📂 `Engineering Problems Benchmark`**
    * Contains Excel results for the **engineering design problems** (`Func_eng`).
* **📂 `Uni, Multi, Fixed Dimensional Modal`**
    * Contains results for **classical test functions** (`fun_info`).
* **📂 `Wilcoxon Rank-Sum P-value`**
    * Contains results for **Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test** generated by (`run_ranksum.m`).

> **Note:** This folder is only for the final reported results and **does not include graphs**. All raw graphs, individual run files, and auto-generated Excel sheets are stored under **`Results and Graphs`** when running `FIM_Comparison.m` inside MATLAB.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Experiments

1.  Open **MATLAB**.
2.  Set the folder **`Matlab Code`** as your working directory.
3.  Run the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:
    ```matlab
    FIM_Comparison
    ```
    All results will be generated automatically.

## ⚙️ How to Change Benchmark Settings

All experiment settings are at the top of the file **`FIM_Comparison.m`** in the section called **User settings**.

### Select the benchmark group

Change the value of `benchName`:

```matlab
benchName = 'CEC2017'
```

Options are: `'fun_info'`, `'CEC2017'`, `'Func_eng'`.

### Select the functions or problems to run

| Benchmark | Variable | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CEC2017** | `Fun_ids` and `Fun_list` | `Fun_ids = [1, 3:30]` <br> `Fun_list = arrayfun(@(k) sprintf('F%d',k), Fun_ids, false)` |
| **Classical functions** | `Fun_ids` and `Fun_list` | `Fun_ids = 1:23` <br> `Fun_list = arrayfun(@(k) sprintf('F%d',k), Fun_ids, false)` |
| **Engineering problems** | `Fun_list` | `Fun_list = {'PressureVesselDesign', 'SpringDesign', 'ThreeBarTruss', 'GearTrainDesign', 'CantileverBeam'}` |

### Change algorithm settings

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Search` | Population size | `Search = 50` |
| `Max_iterations` | Maximum number of iterations | `Max_iterations = 1000` |
| `num_runs` | Number of independent runs | `num_runs = 30` |
| `stats_after_runs` | Run interval for saving statistics | `stats_after_runs = 30` |

### Parallel settings

```matlab
parallel_on = true
num_workers = 10
```

Set `parallel_on = false` to disable parallel execution.

## 📊 Output Location

All results created by **`FIM_Comparison.m`** are saved in the folder:  **📂 `Results and Graphs`**


These files include run values, summary statistics, rankings, and convergence plots.

> The **`Results`** folder in this repository contains the organized results used in the paper.
